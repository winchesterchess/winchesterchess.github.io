# Membership fees
If you decide to continue then annual fees for 2023/24 are £60 (£30 for those 25 or younger). That's less than the price of a pub lemonade per night at the club.

If you want to take part in the Southampton League matches and get an over the board ECF rating then you will also need at least bronze level [English Chess Federation](https://www.englishchess.org.uk/ecf-membership-rates-and-joining-details/) membership.

If you would like more information about the chess club, please contact John Schonenberger, the Membership Secretary, at [schoneys54@gmail.com](mailto:schoneys54@gmail.com), or you can ask in our [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/EPVeIK2a0fd6jqN5h4UKDq).
