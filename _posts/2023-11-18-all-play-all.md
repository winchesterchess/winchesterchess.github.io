Now that our membership seems reasonably stable, we will run an "everybody plays everybody" competition over the next few months. Games to be played on the clock with a 60 minute per side fixed time period (this will ensure that a game can be "easily" completed in an evening). Please notify results to [Bracken](mailto:abdawson@gmail.com) who will keep the score sheet up to date [here](/round-robin/23-24).

On December 20, Mike White will organise an everybody plays everybody "speed" evening. The length of games will be set by the number of people taking part. To help with pre-planning, it would be useful if you can let Mike know in advance whether you will take part.

Finally, there will be NO chess club on December 27 or January 3.

Thx, John
