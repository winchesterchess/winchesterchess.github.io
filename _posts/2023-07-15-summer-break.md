It's the summer break, so the club won't be meeting on Wednesday evenings for a bit while we enjoy the British sunshine. See you all again on Wednesday the 13th September 19:15 at [Badger Farm Community Centre](/join/).

Update: The fist meetup of the 2023/24 season will be Wednesday the 13th September.
