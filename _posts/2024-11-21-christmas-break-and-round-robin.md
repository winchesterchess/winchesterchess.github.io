It's getting close to Christmas. To celebrate Mike will be hosting a casual round-robin blitz tournament for everyone present and willing when we meet on Wednesday the 11th December. Just show up if you want to enter, or [contact us](/contact/) if you might arrive a little late.

The last meeting of 2024 will be Wednesday the 18th December when we will be hosting a home match against Basingstoke. The club will then be closed over the holiday's until we meet again on the 8th January when we will be hosting a home match against Chandlers Ford.

Happy new year!
