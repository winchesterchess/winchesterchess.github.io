I'm pleased to say that Winchester Chess Club returns to [Badger Farm Community Centre](/join/) every Wednesday evening at 19:15 from the 10th September. New members can visit us three time for free, just ring the doorbell and someone will let you in.

Returning members please get your subs to the club treasurer John Schonenberger as soon as you can, our existence depends on it.
