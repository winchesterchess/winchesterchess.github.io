Most nights we will play casual games or mini tournaments. There may also be a home match playing, but you can still come along and play casual games. Some nights there will be many players but it may be quieter if one of our three teams are playing an away match.

# Rated Games
The Club also enters three teams in the [Hampshire League (Southern area)](http://www.sotonchessleague.org.uk/) providing the opportunity to play competitive matches against teams within 45 minutesâ€™ drive.
