Most [nights](/news/updated-2025-26-club-night-schedule) we will play casual games or mini tournaments. There may also be a home match playing, but you can still come along and play casual games. Away matches are scheduled when we are not open, so you can be sure of finding people at the club on our [open nights](/news/updated-2025-26-club-night-schedule).

The Club also enters two teams in the [Southampton Chess League](https://lms.englishchess.org.uk/lms/organisation/415) providing the opportunity to play competitive matches against teams within 45 minutesâ€™ drive.
